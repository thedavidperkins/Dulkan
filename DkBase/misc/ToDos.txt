HIGH PRIORITY:
==============
Add non-trivial descriptor set layouts
Absorb subpass descriptions into render pass init for simple cases
	
LOW PRIORITY:
=============
Design shader specialization implementation
Make dynamic state changes check for dynamic state enabled in pipeline
Allow DkMesh objects to have multiple vertex buffer bindings and nonzero offset values
Develop general descriptor set allocator/manager (accessible by any object representing a descriptor and delivering all info to the pipeline on initialization)
